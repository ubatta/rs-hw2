Code and Dataset is available at:
https://github.com/ubatta/rs-hw2

1. Implemented classifying techniques for two datasets:
    a. Wine data set: winequality-red.csv
2. Implemented algorithm in R:
    a. rs_nq.py - NQueens
    b. rs_om.py - OneMax
    c. rs_ks.py - Knapsack
    d. rs_nn.py - Neural Network

Method of Execution:
Copy all files from the GitHub into one folder and execute as below
1. Copy Rcodes.R, data.csv and winequality-red.csv files in to one directory
2. python rs_nq.py
2. python rs_om.py
2. python rs_ks.py
2. python rs_nn.py
3. The above is the execution methods and should generate the graphs and output.
